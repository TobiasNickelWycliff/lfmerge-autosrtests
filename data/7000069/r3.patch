 "have," "of," and the possessive suffix "-'s." The basic meaning of these words in English is 'to own', but they can mean many other things too. For instance they can mean that I am related to someone (I have a brother), something has a part (birds have wings), and many other ideas. There is also a set of pronouns in English that are like nouns ending in -'s (my/mine, your/yours, his, her/hers, its, our/ours, their/theirs, whose). Use this domain for these general words.</Run>

 'flowers' is the Patient, and 'my wife is the 'Recipient'. In this sentence the only word that marks a case relation is 'to'. English often marks case relations by their position in the sentence. Some languages mark case relations by affixes, prepositions, postpositions, and sometimes special verbs. To completely describe a language, each verb must be investigated, all its case relations must be identified, and all the ways in which these relations are marked must be described. Since verbs are often unique and unpredictable in their case relations, this information should go into the dictionary. This section should be used to classify the words and affixes that are used to mark case relations. This domain should be used for technical terms that refer to case.</Run>
